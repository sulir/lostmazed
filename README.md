Description
-----------

Lostmazed is a 2D game where the user's aim is to get out of a maze. The main game consists of two built-in mazes with an accompanying story. The user controls the player using a keyboard. The maze is not shown all at once, but uses a so-called "fog of war" to hide the whole maze and uncover only the area the player has already visited.

In addition, a maze editor allows the user to create an own maze by combining the background image with a transparent PNG image representing the "walls" of the maze, set the starting and ending point of the maze, test it and save it as a maze file in the program's own format with the extension *.maze. The maze can be later loaded in the editor for further editing. When the maze is finished, its author or (more likely) an another person is able to load the maze and play it.

Requirements
------------

Lostmazed is written is Java and needs the [Soga2D](http://github.com/sulir/soga2d) library.
